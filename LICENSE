Hmmm. Well, what you describe wasn't my intent but I get that this was unclear.
It was also some time ago.

Not sure how to "officially" clear this up except to modify the original email content
removing the constraint to the website/group that was mentioned. So, perhaps, this
will suffice:

"Let this paragraph represent a right to use, distribute, modify, enhance, and otherwise
make available in a nonexclusive manner CP/M and its derivatives. This right comes from
the company, DRDOS, Inc.'s purchase of Digital Research, the company and all assets,
dating back to the mid-1990's. DRDOS, Inc. and I, Bryan Sparks, President of DRDOS,
Inc. as its representative, is the owner of CP/M and the successor in interest of
Digital Research assets."

It's a bit clumsy but this may get the intent cleared and authority upon which it is
granted.

Thanks for the email.

Bryan
